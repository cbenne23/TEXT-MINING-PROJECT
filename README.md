# TEXT-MINING-PROJECT
This data science project involved employing the natural processing language technique ( text mining) to analyze almost 200,000 rows of Amazom reviews for a basket of beauty products and build a suite of competing machine-learning models to determine, based on the textual characteristics of the reviews, whether a review has a high or low rating.
